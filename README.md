Reading log files takes hours, leads to mistake, and takes up costly ressources that could better be used elsewhere. But how can we change that? By bringing the log file to life. Our virtual assistant logai gives your log files a voice and helps you detect problems and errors in thousand lines of text with a simple question.

## How to use the Chatbot #

Be sure to have install the libraries from the requirements.txt using the command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

Just use the command <code>streamlit run chatbot.py</code> on the root level of the project to start the chatbot and start having fun talking to your logs!
